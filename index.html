        The Uploaded Intelligence Research Institute (UIRI) is dedicated to advancing and organizing knowledge in the fields of whole brain emulation and brain preservation. Our mission is to provide a centralized resource for researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in these emerging technologies by collating hard-to-find research, terminology, and relevant studies.

        <div class="section" id="terminology">
            <h2 class="section-title">Terminology and Organizations</h2>
            <p>Explore the key terms and organizations working on Whole Brain Emulation and related research fields. We desperately need NEW conceptual tools too, this list will gradually grow.</p>

        <div class="term">
  <h3>WBE, UI, EM</h3>

            <p>We have a lot of terms to indicate the main focus of the organization because we are still so early: <strong>Emulated Mind (EM (Hansonian), Substrate Independent Minds (Koene), Whole Brain Emulation (Sandberg), Uploaded Intelligence (UIs, (Pantheon)), Digital People, Whole Mind Emulation, Mind Uploading (Classical).</strong>
                <p></p>

Ultimately we are already vastly different from humans of the past, it is likely that we will similarly refer to ourselves as humans in the future too. Whole Brain Emulation is the most technical term of them all (simulation v emulation, whole brain, inspired by comp neuro), so it is primarily referenced in roadmaps and generally when considering technical challenges. Substrate independent minds is arguably the most evocative in terms of philosophical and practical implications. Mind Uploading, and Uploaded Intelligence, are widely used by the general public. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Medical-Legal Delay</h3>
  <p>Refers to the degradation of brain cells that occurs due to delays in obtaining legal permissions for post-mortem procedures. This delay leads to rapid cell death, making it harder to preserve the brain in a state suitable for emulation or detailed study.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Edema</h3>
  <p>Edema refers to the accumulation of excess fluid in the tissues of the brain, which can severely hinder preservation efforts. During perfusion, this fluid buildup causes swelling, distorting the brain’s structure and making it harder to preserve fine details such as synaptic connections. Perfusion causing edemas is one of the most pressing issues in brain preservation today, as it impairs the ability to achieve high-quality preservation needed for Whole Brain Emulation (WBE).</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Perfusion</h3>
  <p>Perfusion is the process of circulating fixative chemicals through blood vessels to preserve biological tissues, including the brain. In the context of WBE and brain preservation, perfusion can be challenging because improper techniques can lead to edema, while delayed perfusion can cause cell death and degradation of brain structures essential for emulation.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Immersion Fixation</h3>
  <p>A preservation method where the brain is submerged in a fixative solution, allowing chemicals to diffuse into the tissue rather than circulating through blood vessels. While it avoids some issues like edema, immersion fixation tends to be less efficient at preserving the deeper structures of the brain compared to perfusion. However, it's widely used in brain banks due to its simplicity and lower resource requirements.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Internal Carotid Artery Cannulation</h3>
  <p>A specific method for delivering fixative chemicals directly into the brain via the internal carotid artery. This technique is considered best practice today for brain preservation, though it carries risks of edema if not done properly.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Brain Banks</h3>
  <p>Brain banks are institutions that store human brains for research and preservation. These facilities are often unregulated and can vary in quality. In some cases, they may simply acquire brains from research facilities and store them with minimal standards. Establishing well-regulated brain banks is crucial for preserving brains under optimal conditions for WBE research.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Immersion Fixation Viability</h3>
  <p>Immersion fixation appears to work for most brain banks despite being a simpler method compared to perfusion. Given the low cost and minimal resource requirements, it’s still widely used, though it may not be ideal for long-term structural preservation.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Cryopreservation</h3>
  <p>Freezing biological tissues at extremely low temperatures to halt biological processes, with the goal of reviving or preserving them indefinitely. While promising, it presents major technical challenges for WBE. ASC seems promising but is expensive. Straight freeze and other older techniques cause unacceptable amounts of ultrastructural ice damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Connectome</h3>
  <p>The complete map of neural connections in the brain. For WBE, preserving the connectome is critical as it represents the neural architecture needed for emulating brain function.</p>
</div>

<div class="term">
  <h3>Vacuole Artifacts</h3>
  <p>Hollow spaces that form in brain tissues during preservation, often due to improper fixative techniques. These artifacts distort the brain's fine structure, complicating efforts to map the connectome.</p>
</div>
